# Unical

An attempt at an improved version of cal, with support for arbitrary
calendrical systems and dual calendar display.

## Why

Good question

## You say 'attempt', how's it going

So far I have replicated most of cal (except the -A and -B options) - but, so
far, none of ncal.

## What's wrong with ncal

Nothing, but that's not the interesting bit to me. I want to try and implement
a cal that can handle the Jewish, Islamic, Chinese, French Revolutionary etc
calendars.

ncal adds various alternate display options, can calculate the date of Easter,
and knows on what day different countries switched from Julian to Gregorian.

All great stuff which I will add later, but not the main thing rn.
