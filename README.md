# Unical

An attempt at an improved version of cal, with support for arbitrary
calendrical systems and dual calendar display.

## Why

Good question

## You say 'attempt', how's it going

So far I have replicated most of cal (except the -A and -B options) - but, so
far, none of ncal.

## What's wrong with ncal

Nothing, but that's not the interesting bit to me. I want to try and implement
a cal that can handle the Jewish, Islamic, Hindu, Chinese, French Revolutionary
etc calendars.

ncal adds various alternate display options, can calculate the date of Easter,
and knows on what day different countries switched from Julian to Gregorian.

All great stuff which I will add later, but not the main thing rn.

## Have you looked up the word 'hubris', I mean, recently?

What are you trying to say?

## Let me rephrase that. Have you actually looked up any of those other calendars.

A bit. I mean, I am Jewish, so, you know, I do know what a lunisolar calendar is. Thanks.

## Are you sure?

Well, sort of. Mostly. I've read about it a bit.

## Uh-oh

Are you saying there's a reason this hasn't already been done?

## Well it certainly isn't trivial

No, obviously. But surely some bits are easier than others.

## Why do you think ncal guy did the multiple location-bound change dates between the Gregorian and Julian calendars bit before anything else?

What?

## I think you heard me

You can't be serious.

## O God

Maybe I'll start with the French Revolutionary Calendar. How hard can that be?
They were trying to simplify things, after all. Metric system and all that.

## Ten day weeks. No clear set of rules for leap days. Divergent ideas about what was actually meant and not actually in use any more anyway.

Oh shit

## Yeah

Alright then, what about the Islamic calendar. Surely...

## It doesn't have a universally agreed-upon notion that fixed calculation methods are ok.

It.. what? Fine. The Chinese one then.

## There's two ways of doing it, one lunisolar, one solar

What?

## That's what Wikipedia says. It knows no more than you do, and if there are fixed methods, doesn't mention them.

Alright then, the Hindu calendar

## Oh sure, which tradition will you implement first?

Which... what? How many are there?

## There's quite a few. By which I mean loads. All slightly different.

Ok. Probably I have no business trying any of these. But the Jewish one, surely,
I can do that.

## Sure. Read the thing about the Four Gates again.

I did.

## Do you understand it?

No.

## Huh.

Huh.
